                    </div>
                    <p2>Little concrete information remains about Uncanny Yarns' owner and financer, James Arthur Donald (known as J.A.D.
                        to his colleagues). Accounts of his life before Uncanny Yarns are fragmentary and often contradictory. Some place his birth in Chicago, the city that Uncanny Yarns was published in, while other accounts place his birth in India,
                        on a U.S. Army base. J.A.D. was a man of considerable wealth. The source of this wealth is, like most other facets of his personal life, not well understood. Surviving letters make reference to a series of "astute        investments" and inheritances, but there are also extensive records of monetary losses that call J.A.D.'s financial acumen into question. Uncanny Yarns' accountant recalls:
                        <div
                            class="card card-body bg-light mt-3">
                            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                                "To give you a picture of what kind of businessman he [J.A.D.] was, let me tell you a story: I was trying to get his records to make some semblance of sense, and to cancel his order for embossed covers—embossed covers on a 25 cent monthly pulp!—when he comes barreling in, chewing on those godawful cigars he always had. He never smoked them, just chewed them until there was bits of tobacco over the entire office. He tells me, 'Sam, those embossed covers will make us a mint. Trust me on this. I got a keen sense. They'll make us enough money to fight off those Freemason sonsabitches. Keep up the great work.' I tried to reason with him, but he was out the door before I could ask him what the hell he meant. I cleaned off the tobacco from my desk and suddenly I can't hear the printer on the other end of the phone! It turns out our phone lines went dead because J.A.D. had set up an account with a brand-new offshoot of the Pony Express. Those embossed covers cost us 5,000 dollars and nearly put us out of business."
                            </blockquote>
                        </div> <br>
                        Nonetheless, the publication managed to power through the '30s and survived long enough to experience a revival in the '50s. It carried an erratic publication schedule all the way into the '80s. In addition to financing and publishing Uncanny Yarns, J.A.D. wrote stories for almost every issue of the obscure magazine. This put him somewhat at odds with the editors he had hired, who felt his work wasn't up to the standards they set for other writers.
                        The exact terms of the contract between J.A.D. and his editors are unclear, but there was undeniable tension between them. This is apparent in the table of contents for each issue, which firmly reminded the reader that they were "contractually required" to publish J.A.D.'s stories, and a note at the back of every issue that clarified that these stories had not been edited.
                        This hostility was tempered by the considerable leeway that J.A.D. gave his staff in the day-to-day operations
                        of the publication. For the most part, according to his editors, J.A.D. had very little input into the content
                        of each issue, only forbidding certain topics such as open discussion of the Federal Reserve and gold standard.
                        Because of this leeway, and the mysterious financial backing, Uncanny Yarns was one of the more progressive
                        publications of its time, more akin to its European counterparts than the magazines it shared space with on
                        American shelves, with numerous heroic Black characters and one of the first neutral depictions of homosexuality
                        (however veiled) in a U.S. pulp. Jackson Becks (real name Levi Berkovitz), a frequent contributor to the magazine, recalls a discussion with J.A.D. about politics:
                        [block quote]
                        "One could never get a sense of where he was at. He seemed real keen to let a lot of voices through. I appreciated that. But he also said the damnedest things that I couldn't make sense of. I'm not saying the man was prejudiced. But at the same time, I guess, well, you could say he did have prejudices, even if
                        he wasn't prejudiced himself. You understand? I was with him at the bar, celebrating the warm reception of 'Man Timber,' one of my horror stories. He tells me, 'Jack, I am glad the Jews killed Lincoln. Damn fine people, those
                        sons of Israel." Just out of nowhere, he tells me this. I didn't know if I should sock him one or thank him or what. He didn't know I was Jewish at that time, you see. He goes on, saying Lincoln was 'a filthy Mason' who was going to reinstate slavery and 'turn on the fine Negro race after the war of Northern Aggression.'
                        Well, I'm three drinks to Sunday and don't know what to make of it. I didn't know whether to report him to some
                        agency or buy him another round. That's the kind of man he was."</p2>

                        <h3>Michael R. Chappell &nbsp </h3>
                    </div>
                    <p2>Nothing is known of Michael Chappell's life before or after Uncanny Yarns. In fact, there is little evidence he even existed outside of that small stretch of time beyond hearsay and anecdotes. The magazine's accountant theorizes
                        that Mr. Chappell had assumed his identity to take on the editing job and then changed it back once it was     over. A strong believer in financier J.A.D.'s radium cures, Mr. Chappell's business cards were all printed with radium-infused ink. It is estimated that, during his tenure, Mr. Chappell handed out roughly three thousand business cards, making him one of the leading causes of cancer in the Chicago area in the 1930s. In addition, Mr. Chappell would regularly ingest a "vigor-enhancing" miracle cure made of radium, gin, and various unknown chemicals. Accounts report that Mr. Chappell would often go without sleep for stretches of four days or more, only for his coworkers to realize he had been accidentally editing other magazines. He would then spend the next seven days after these bouts drifting in and out of consciousness, mostly incoherent but
                        insistent that his plants be watered. His love of gardening showed in his ample cactus collection, as well as
                        his prized pineapple garden. He was never seen without a pineapple or pineapple-themed accesory, carried
                        as displays of status and wealth, and he would frequently brandish a gun on anyone who got too close to his pineapple garden, regardless of how long he knew them. He is known to have written the following stories, although he is likely to have penned many others under pseudonyms:
                        
                        "Tremulous Towers"

                        "Deadly Ruins"

                        "Twisted Theater of Death on the
                        Planet of Horror, or; The Phantom of
                        Rectitude Comes to Roost Once More"

                        <h3>C. F. Howitt &nbsp </h3>
                    </div>
                    <p3>Details of Mr. Howitt's life, unlike that of Mr. Chappell, are far from fragmentary. In fact, Mr. Howitt
                        wrote several autobiographies during his tenure at Uncanny Yarns, though all of them remain unpublished. These
                        autobiographies are detailed, consistent with the timelines gathered from other accounts, and unreadably boring.
                        The few people who have read these autobiographies report that Mr. Howitt's health problems started early. By the
                        age of 26, his arthritis was so bad that he could no longer go to birthday parties. His health continued to deteriorate after this. By age 27, he had been to doctors all over the world and had been diagnosed with chronic
                        inflammation, porphyria, recurring Arctic hysteria, traumatic constitution, trembling disease, and psychathenia,
                        and it was discovered that his spine was fusing together. By age 28, he had written 33 suicide notes, but had
                        discarded them all as being "too wordy." After becoming co-lead editor at Uncanny Yarns, Mr. Howitt lead a somewhat more lively existence, finding that his job afforded him the opportunity to write as well as edit. In all, Mr. Howitt wrote at least one story for every issue of Uncanny Yarns, often multiple, and there are rumors that he penned entire issues himself. After many angry letters concerning a homosexual character in one of his stories, Mr. Howitt chose the pseudonym "F. C. Wittoh" to continue writing until the end of his tenure. He had several long-running series, which appeared throughout Uncanny Yarns's run even after he retired from editing, including:

                        --"The Cada Chronicles," set in an ambiguous mix of far-future and far-past and following the immortal character
                        of Uep, who rose centuries after a premature burial. This series also followed a colorful cast of side characters and had a tendency to wander through narrative threads before looping back to the main action. Uep's non-heterosexual nature, almost unheard of at the time, was alternately defended or whitewashed by the editing team, depending on the market. Most versions of the story have these references wiped away entirely.

                        --"The Times of Colorado," following a mysterious gunslinger named Colorado and his encounters with unexplainable
                        phenomena. Part of the "Weird Western" subgenre of pulp fiction, stories from this series were mostly told from
                        perspectives other than the title character's in order to enhance the mystery.

                        His immense output, combined with his editing duties, eventually put enough strain on Mr. Howitt that he had to
                        take a long break from his job, during which Mr. Chappell took over full editing duties and comandeered Mr. Howitt's office. When Mr. Howitt tried to get his office back, Mr. Chappell is reported to have told him he "should have hopped on board the radium train like a man" and refused to give up either office. For the remainder of their tenures, Mr. Chappell worked from both offices and used one to house his pineapples and cacti.</p3>
